bio: "My name is Sam, and I was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) in August 2016. I was 22 years old and I had just graduated college a few months prior. While I feel like I have dealt with my diagnosis pretty well, I found that writing about my T1D has helped me overcome the many challenges that I have faced while battling this disease."
