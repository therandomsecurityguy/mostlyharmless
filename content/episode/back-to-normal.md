Description = "Are we back to normal? The crew catches up with recent races and futre ultra plans. They are also joined by [Nate](https://mostlyharmlessrunning.com/ramen-i-barely-knew-him/) before he attempts the [Veteran's Memorial 150](https://www.vm150.com/), a brutal 150 mile footrace across Michigan. Maybe ramen will work for him this time. ðŸ˜€"
