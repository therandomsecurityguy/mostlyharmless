Description = "Motley Crew: an informal expression for a roughly organized assembly of individuals of various backgrounds, appearance, and character. This sums up the [PRorER](https://pr-or-er.com/) crew. Matt and Alyssa speak with Russ and Mike (our glorious tent daddy) on their recent experiences on completing 100k at the [Eagle Up Ultra](https://www.runcanton.com/eagle-up-ultra). They discuss training plans, redemption, and their sheer will to finish. Enjoy!"
